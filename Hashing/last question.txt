If the table size is more than 20,000 and the words to insert are 8000, is the above hashing algorithm adequate ? why ?

Yes the above applied algorithm will meet the requirements of hashing since Load Factor remains less than 0.5.
 However, the table size to be defined will be next prime number after 20000 i.e. 20011.
